* Overview

** import data for US
- confirmed cases
- deaths

** apply filter (new column)
- make new column (e.g., exclusion code)
- 0 => keep
- 1 => exclude for reason X
- 10 => exclude for reason Y
- 100 => exclude for reason Z
- count exclusion codes (expect 10 ** n)

** re-shape
- each row is a date
- each column is state + county

** make summary table for latest date
- total cases in data set
- segment by exclusion code
- segment by state (include number of counties and population)

** write table to file
